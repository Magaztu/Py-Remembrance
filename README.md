# Py-Remembrance
As the description says, this is a repo that serves two purposes:
- One, posting my old Python scripts + revisiting them.
- Two, practice and create new Python scripts and ideas.

I'm by no means a master, but neither am I a beginner, this is proof to myself that I've made progress and that I will keep on improving.
